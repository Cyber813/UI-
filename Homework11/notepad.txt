Question 1 :

Difference between arr.forEach() and arr.map() ?

A:  arr.forEach() : It iterates a value for each element and doesn't return any value.

arr.map():

It returns a new value for each element in an array.
It maps the current element with the new value.

Question 2 :

What is an Object and Object Methods (.hasOwnProperty(item))?

A: Object : It is a collection of name value pairs.

object methods:

These are the actions that can be performed on objects and it could be properties and values. 

function definition is also a method in javascript object.

In this example 

var object1 = {firstName: "Tejasudha", lastName:"Gariganti"};

console.log(object1.firstName);
var object2 = Object.create(object1);
console.log(object2.firstName);

console.log("firstName" in object1);//true
console.log("firstName" in object2);//true
console.log(object1.hasOwnProperty("firstName")); //true
console.log(object2.hasOwnProperty("firstName")); // false


object2 is inherited from object1 and the object like that doesnot satisfy with the hasOwnProperty.
Inherited object doesn't satisfy the hasOwnProperty.

Where as 'in' method satisfies both the properties.

Question 3: Different ways of creating an object.

A: Javascript objects created in 3 different ways
1) By using new  keyword
2) By using object literal
3) By using constructor.

From the first 2 ways it creates only the single object where as from the last way it constructs the multiple instances from the constructed object.


Question 4: Understand about properties and 
Adding a property, deleting a property,  edit the property value, check the property.

A: properties are associated with the javascript object.
An object is a collection of properties.


Question 5: What is Prototype in object ?

A: Objects have different properties and some may be methods and some may be properties.
Arrays , boolean values can be property too.

Every object consisting of properties and methods  associated with the another object that is called prototype object of that object. 

An empty object may inherited the properties and methods from the prototype object.


They inherit the properties and methods from the prototype object. 

Objects which are created using an object literal and new Object() will inherit from the Obect.prototype.
