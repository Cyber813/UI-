Question1: What is constructor? A new keyword and Why do we use it?

Constructor: Any function which is used as a constructor. It is used with the new keyword

Question2: 
instanceof

It checks whether an object is in its prototype chain and created from a prototype property of a constructor.


object instanceof constructor

It follows only the prototype chain and checks the current object and return true if the object is of the specified object type.


check the type of an object at run time.


Question 3: 

prototype:

Objects have different properties and some may be methods and some may be properties.
Arrays , boolean values can be property too.

Every object consisting of properties and methods  associated with the another object that is called prototype object of that object. 

An empty object may inherited the properties and methods from the prototype object.


They inherit the properties and methods from the prototype object. 

Objects which are created using an object literal and new Object() will inherit from the Obect.prototype.



Question 4: this keyword.

It owns the function if it is defined inside a function.
and same with object.


It is defined in Global context and Function context.
i) In Global Context , this refers to the global object and window object is equal to global object.
ii) In Function Context, this depends on how the function is called.





this is all about scope. Every function has its own scope, 

So everytime a function executes, a new "instance" of that function has a new meaning of "this".
