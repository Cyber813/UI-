Question :  JavaScript call Apply Bind Methods? How to use them? What are the use cases when the use cases when we have to use them?



1) bind():

It allows to set a value to a specific object, reuse a method and curry a function
It creates a new function where the 'this' keyword used to refer a value of the created function used by the bind method to create a new function 
Using the this keyword value assignig that property value to the newly created function using the bind method

2) call():

It directly invokes the new object and parameters are given inside the object. It invokes the function immediately



3)apply():

apply() is also same as the call(), the difference is at it takes the list of arguments in the array list.

Usecase : 1) Function Borrowing using call(),apply() and bind()

When a new object is defined and then if there is  a need of function. By using the bind() , call()  and apply() would assign the function property to that new object.


2) Function Currying using call(), apply() and bind()

When the new object is created using call(), apply(), and bind() there is a new copy created keeping the default prototype parameters and just changing the values.
